# React Native Exercises
In this repository, I will post my progress in doing some React Native exercises. In my humble opinion, these exercises will give you a great start for developing applications in React Native

## First application: Custom Font
To do these, you should step forward by these steps:
1. Download some font (e.g Google Fonts)
2. Add font file to src/assets/fonts
3. Create react-native.config.js file
4. Write code for the module
5. Setup @react-native-asset library
6. Style your text component with new font (fontFamily)
