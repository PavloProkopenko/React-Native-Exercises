# React Native Exercises
In this repository, I will post my progress in doing some React Native exercises. In my humble opinion, these exercises will give you a great start for developing applications in React Native

## First application: Custom Font
To do these, you should step forward by these steps:
1. Download some font (e.g Google Fonts)
2. Add font file to src/assets/fonts
3. Create react-native.config.js file
4. Write code for the module
5. Setup @react-native-asset library
6. Style your text component with new font (fontFamily)

## Second application: Custom SVG picture
To do these, you should step forward by these steps:
1. Download some SVG picture
2. Add this picture to your project (e.g src/svg/Heart.svg)
3. Download react-native-svg library (also, I added react-native-svg-transformer to my project)
4. Create file declarations.d.ts and write code (more details you can read in [documentation](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer))
5. Create file metro.config.js (if it doesn't exist)
6. Write code for config (more details in [library documentation](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer))
7. Add SVG picture as a component to App.tsx

## Third application: Gradient background
If you want to make a program with gradient background, you should follow these steps:
1. Add react-native-linear-gradient library
2. Import component to your App.tsx
3. Wrap view component to LinearGradient component
4. Write some style code for your components
